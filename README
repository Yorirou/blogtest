My first webmachine application. This is kind of a sophisticated hello world.

This is only for educational / testing purposes. No authentication or any kind of security checks.

0. Download non-erlang dependencies:
   $ ./dljsdeps.sh

1. Build the skeleton application:
   $ make
   - or -
   $ ./rebar compile

2. Start up the skeleton application:
   $ ./start.sh

3. URL
   http://localhost:8000

Note that the very first page load might take some time, beacuse Mnesia will initialize the database.
